# OpenALEX File Downloader Test Summary

## Working Components
- Basic initialization and configuration loading
- File path generation for most scenarios
- OpenAccess checking when API is not available or returns non-success
- File handling with non-existing files
- Publications orchestration (high-level coordination)

## Issues to Fix

### Async Mock Setup
1. **Error in `mock_aiofiles_open` fixture**:
   - The AsyncMock for aiofiles.open is not properly configured
   - Error occurs when setting `mock_open.return_value.__aenter__.return_value = mock_file`
   - Need to correctly mock async context managers

2. **Runtime Warnings**:
   - Many coroutines like `AsyncMockMixin._execute_mock_call` were never awaited
   - Happens when mocking async functions but not awaiting them properly

### Test Failures
1. **Config Loading**: `test_load_config_yaml_found` fails - mock is not properly returning sample config

2. **Publication ID Handling**: `test_get_file_path_no_pub_id` fails - possibly related to how generate_id is mocked

3. **OpenAccess API**: `test_check_oa_unpaywall_success` fails - issues with mocking session responses

4. **URL Resolution Issues**:
   - `test_resolve_url_direct_download` fails - problems with mocking `session.head`
   - `test_resolve_url_not_direct` fails - similar async mocking issues

5. **HTTP Download Issues**:
   - 3 download tests fail with ERRORS - related to aiohttp and aiofiles mocking
   - `test_download_aiohttp_http_error` fails - likely due to incorrect session.get mocking

6. **Scidownl Integration**:
   - Both scidownl tests fail - likely due to improper mocking of async storage functions

7. **File Validation**:
   - `test_validate_success_pdf` errors during setup
   - `test_validate_file_too_small` fails - possibly related to mock storage config

8. **Orchestration Issues**:
   - Several download orchestration tests fail - likely cascading from the above issues
   - `test_download_openalex_files_entrypoint` fails - top level function integration issue

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Fix AsyncMock Configuration**:
   - Properly set up async context managers in test fixtures
   - Ensure all coroutines are properly awaited in tests
   - Use pytest-asyncio correctly for async test functions

2. **Fix Storage Mocking**:
   - Ensure async storage methods are properly mocked
   - Make sure async methods return awaitable objects

3. **Fix URL and Session Handling**:
   - Properly mock aiohttp ClientResponse objects
   - Ensure session.get and session.head mocks return appropriate response objects

4. **Fix External Service Integration**:
   - Properly mock scidownl interactions
   - Ensure external API calls are correctly simulated

5. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Add better error handling in the implementation
   - Make sure tests validate error conditions correctly
